# BGRAP

The definition of effective strategies for graph partitioning is a major challenge in distributed environments since an effective graph partitioning allows to considerably improve the performance of large graph data analytics computations. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective and scalable Balanced GRAph Partitioning (B-GRAP) algorithm to produce balanced graph partitions. B-GRAP is based on Label Propagation (LP) approach and defines different objective functions to deal with either vertex or edge balance constraints while considering edge direction in graphs. The experiments are performed on various graphs while varying the number of partitions. We evaluate B-GRAP using several quality measures and the computation time. The results show that B-GRAP (i) provides a good balance while reducing the cuts between the different computed partitions (ii) reduces the global computation time, compared to Spinner algorithm.
